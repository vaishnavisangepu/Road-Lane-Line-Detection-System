# Road-Lane-Line-Detection-System
A Road Lane Line Detection System is a key feature in modern vehicles, particularly for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving.
It uses forward-facing cameras and sometimes additional sensors like LiDAR or radar to capture real-time road images. 
These images are processed using computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings, helping the vehicle maintain its lane and enhance driving safety. 
This technology is essential for functions such as lane-keeping assistance and automated lane changes.
